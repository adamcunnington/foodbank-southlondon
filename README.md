## Overview
This codebase contains the frontend and backend of a very simple website that is designed to run locally. It is designed to simplify the process for tracking the status of food parcels for clients in FoodBank, South London. The website enables users to print various documents and labels and update status information for clients that food parcels are being prepared for / delivered to. All data is stored in protected Google Sheets. More information, for those who have access, can be found in the [shared Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0ABoZT0Wte3WNUk9PVA).
